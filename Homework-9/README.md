### What's this for:

There are two webpages that are designed to measure two different map interaction techniques: Searching locations only by dragging and zooming on the map; Searching locations with a search textbox and a map.
Several locations will be provided to the Participants and requires them to locate the position on the map. Speed and correctness will be recorded for analysis.



### How to use these two .html files as prototype for testing:

Organizer:
1. Open the two pages with a common web browser on a PC. Start the experiment and observe the behaviors.
Use these link:

https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/AnarchyKitten/COMP171-Prototype/blob/main/Homework-9/MapUITest.html#

Participants:
2. For each experiment, click on the "new" button to generate a new location.
3. Click "Start" button and then try to use the UI on the right side to find these locations.
4. Click "Stop" button after the tester found the locations.

Organizer:
5. Click on "Yes" or "No" button to record the correctness of the search.

Repeat step 2-5 for six times until no new locations pop out.

Organizer:
6. Keep an record of the result table on the bottom. (You can do a screenshot or take a photo)
7. Summarize and compare the results based on the result table and observation.
